    <P style="color: aliceblue;"> Ever since i was a kid, i have always been fascinatednby how the system unit is arranged. I actually enjoyed dismantling it anf fixing it again. I my passion grew when i saw diferent types of system unit cases. let me say my inspiration is the system unit.</P>
    <p style="color: aliceblue;"> I also chose computer engineering because of our developing world. Very soon only technology will be a greatest requirement in the world thus i need to equip some skills to fit inside this world. </p>
