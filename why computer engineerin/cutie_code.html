  <h1>WHY I CHOSE COMPUTER ENGINEERING</h1>
  <h4>HELLO,</h4>
   <h5> I'm HARRIET ADDOBEAH YEBOAH . A computer engineering student.</h5>  
  <p>I chose this program because of my enthusiasm in the system unit.
    Lemme say the system unit was what inspired me to do this course.
    well i had the habit of fixing my system unit whenever i had a problem with my computer syatem.
    this was when i was little.
  </p>
       <p>I also love building cool things to suit my environment.
        and i hope this course helps  me to widen my understanding about computer hardware.
